Here's an animation showing the process. This was a quick 30 minute session to try and create some combo of blurry circles (the image above). There were a few speedbumps that are shown in this clip that got fixed along the way: switching from random() to randomGaussian(), keeping x/y radii consistent, typos, etc. Also wanted to see if dots or full circles looked better. This is a work in progress, it's just fun to show the actual process of working through this stuff.
